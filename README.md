# Quarto Examples
Examples of building reports in Quarto! Based on my Posit blog post: https://posit.co/blog/building-a-reporting-infrastructure-with-quarto/

This repo is currently a work in progress. Will be adding alot more content including demos, explanations, and possibly video in the near future.

## Simple PDF Report
Covers creating a simple PDF report with headers/footers and some programmatic tables and plots. 

## Advanced PDF Formatting
Demonstrates how LaTex can be used in Quarto to create custom pdfs.

## Parameterized Report
Demonstrates how Quarto and shell scripts can be used to create an automated parameterized report resulting in a single Quarto file capable of rendering multiple dynamic reports. YAML could also be used in place of shell.

## Output to Different Formats
Shows how Quarto and shell can automatically render multiple file formats using a single Quarto file.

## Coming Soon
* Interactive Quarto reports
* Populating Word and PowerPoint templates with Quarto
* Creating a Quarto Project and all its benefits
